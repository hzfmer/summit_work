pmcl3d.c:
new routine, which splits stress update in inside of subdomain into two parts:
the first part (upper and lower) is updated while velocities left and right are exchanged
the second part (inside region)  is updated while yield factor front and back are computed and exchanged
the yield factors left and right are swapped while yield factors in inside domain is calculated

pmcl3d_nostresssplit.c:	
old routine, which exchanges yield factors for front, back, left and right while yield factors in inside domain are calculated.
