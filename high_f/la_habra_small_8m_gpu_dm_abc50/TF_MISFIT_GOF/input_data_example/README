File "HF_TF-MISFIT_GOF" contains the input parameters
for the computation of misfits and goodness-of-fit criteria (GOFs)
between the two signals specified
in the files with "S1_NAME" and "S2_NAME".

In this example you can find a part of the data 
that were used in our GJI 2009 paper:
- both signals are three-component signals, 
- signal with "S2_NAME" is considered as the reference one,
("S1_NAME" signal is the result of numerical modeling 
and the real data are used as "S2_NAME" signal)
- misfits and GOFs are globally normalized
