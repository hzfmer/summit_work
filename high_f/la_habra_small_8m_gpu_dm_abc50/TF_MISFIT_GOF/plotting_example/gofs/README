This Matlabs script is a simple example of plotting of 
goodness-of-fit criteria (GOFs) results.
----------------------------------------------------------------
It plots time-frequency GOFs results TFEG1-TFEG3 (computed with 
program "TF_MISFITS_GOF_CRITERIA" for each component of the signal) 
in Matlab Figures and it also produces png (or tiff) files 
"TFEG1.png" ("TFEG1.tiff").
"TFEG2.png" ("TFEG2.tiff")
"TFEG3.png" ("TFEG3.tiff")

In the attached png files  you can see what you should obtain 
after running the "PlotTFEG.m" Matlab script. 

In this example you can find a part of data 
that were used in our GJI 2009 paper:
- both signals are three-component signals, 
- signal with "S2_NAME" is considered as the reference one
("S1_NAME" signal is the result of numerical modeling 
and the real data are used as "S2_NAME" signal),
- GOFs are globally normalized
