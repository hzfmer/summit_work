NOTES:

0) The order of the above input parameters should not be changed.

1) The number of procs should evenly divide into its respective model
   dimension (e.g., NX/NPX = INTEGER).

2) Expected proc configurations are stacked boxes (e.g., 2X2X2),
   vertical columns (e.g., 4X2X1) or x-normal planes (e.g., 8X1X1).
   The code can be run with only one proc, but would not be as
   efficient as a non-MPI code.

3) The resulting proc size in each direction should be greater then
   the PML thickness (e.g., NX/NPX > ND).  This rule does not apply
   when the Cerjan mode is used.

4) The PML width should not exceed 20.

5) The number of procs requested (outside this program) should be the
   product of the number of procs in each direction (NPX*NPY*NPZ),
   (e.g., 3X3X3 procs does not match 14X2 procs in the batch script).

6) Sources, receivers and the velocity model are all referenced from
   the free surface (z=1) and the south-west corner (y=1, x=1).

7) File names and paths are currently limited to 99 characters without
   modification (change in pmcl3d.f) and recompilation.

8) Waveforms can be altered when using the visco option by changing the
   tau distribution in relax.f (recompilation necessary).

9) The Cerjan ABC option is available for highly heterogenous models
   that cause instability in the PML ABCs.  Typically boundary widths
   are 20 - 50.

10) The ouput is setup for two sets of files; the intention for one
    being surface recorded seismograms and the other volumes.  Both
    must be regularly spaced, but the specific usage is left up to the
    user.
